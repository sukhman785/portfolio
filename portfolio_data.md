## 1. Professional Identity

- **Full Name**: Sukhman Brar  
- **Role/Title**: Software Engineer | Cloud & Security-Focused Platform Engineer  
- **One-Liner**: I build secure, production-ready cloud systems that combine observability, automation, and infrastructure guardrails.  
- **Value Proposition**: I operate at the intersection of software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and security. With hands-on experience in automation pipelines, cloud deployments, detection engineering, and secure Terraform baselines, I design systems that are both scalable and secure by default.

## 2. Key Projects

### Project 1

- **Title**: Cloud AutoOps (Observability & Automated Response Platform)  
- **Description**: An end-to-end observability platform that simulates structured service logs, performs rule-based and ML-based anomaly detection, triggers alerts, and executes automated remediation flows. Includes a FastAPI backend, realtime WebSocket alert streaming, incident lifecycle management, and a React dashboard. Containerized with Docker Compose and deployable to AWS EC2 using Terraform.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, React, WebSockets, SQLite, Docker, Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions  
- **Impact/Results**: Demonstrates full-stack systems design, realtime event streaming, anomaly detection, infrastructure-as-code deployment, and CI validation workflows for a production-style cloud system.  
- **Links**: GitHub (Cloud AutoOps)

### Project 2

- **Title**: Terraform AWS Security Baseline  
- **Description**: A modular Terraform AWS baseline that provisions secure-by-default infrastructure with enforced guardrails, including blocked open SSH, S3 public access block, KMS encryption, IMDSv2, least-privilege IAM roles, and encrypted logging. Integrated DevSecOps CI gates to prevent insecure infrastructure changes from merging.  
- **Tech Stack**: Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions, Checkov, tfsec, TFLint  
- **Impact/Results**: Demonstrates preventative cloud security architecture, policy-as-code enforcement, IAM design, networking controls, and CI-integrated security validation.  
- **Links**: GitHub (Terraform AWS Security Baseline)

### Project 3 (Polishing)

- **Title**: MolView (Full-Stack Chemical Data Platform)  
- **Description**: A full-stack web application for extracting and storing chemical compound data, featuring a RESTful API and responsive client interface. Built using C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript technologies. Currently being refined for production readiness, testing, and improved API design.  
- **Tech Stack**: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS  
- **Impact/Results**: Demonstrates backend data processing, REST API architecture, database integration, and full-stack application development.  
- **Links**: GitHub (MolView – polishing in progress)

### Project 4 (Planned – SWE Focused)

- **Title**: Distributed Systems / Backend Engineering Project (Planned)  
- **Description**: A backend-focused software engineering project designed to showcase deeper system design, performance considerations, API design patterns, and scalable service architecture. This project will emphasize clean abstractions, testing strategy, and production-style engineering practices.  
- **Tech Stack**: TBD (Likely Python/Go/Node.js + Postgres + Docker)  
- **Impact/Results**: Will demonstrate advanced backend engineering, system design reasoning, and production-quality code structure.  
- **Links**: Coming Soon

## 3. About Me

- **Short Bio**:  
I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph graduating in April 2026. Through internships in security operations, cyber intelligence, and software development, I’ve developed a strong interest in building secure cloud systems and automation pipelines. My work spans incident response, detection engineering, infrastructure automation, and full-stack development. I’m particularly interested in platform engineering, cloud security, and DevSecOps roles where I can design resilient systems and enforce security guardrails at scale.

- **Top Skills**:  
  - Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Terraform)  
  - DevSecOps & CI/CD Security  
  - Backend Engineering (Python, FastAPI, Node.js)  
  - Observability & Automation  
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
  - Incident Response & Detection Engineering
